**Note: This material is largely deprecated.  in the future, I will make separate projects for individual components.**

**Note: The material in the *specfun* directory is deprecated.**

The true guts of this work and much more is hosted in the tr29124_test repo: https://github.com/emsr/tr29124_test.git

The distributions have gone to https://github.com/emsr/cxx_random.git

The Mie Scattering code has gone to https://github.com/emsr/MieScatter.git

Things like filesystem, variant, and any have been cleaned out as they are shipped already.
